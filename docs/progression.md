# Stage Two Progression Design: Advanced Pixel Systems

## Overview

After mastering RGB pixel collection and white pixel conversion, players need deeper strategic systems that reward planning, experimentation, and optimization. This document outlines interconnected progression mechanics inspired by games like The Prestige Tree.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Layered Complexity**: Each system builds on previous mechanics while introducing new strategic depth
2. **Meaningful Choices**: Multiple viable strategies with trade-offs, no single "optimal" path
3. **Emergent Synergies**: Systems interact in discoverable ways that reward experimentation
4. **Active Engagement**: Balance idle progression with strategic decision-making moments
5. **Reset Value**: Prestige systems that feel rewarding, not punishing
